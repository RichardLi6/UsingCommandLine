2. Check the directories available using the `dir` command.
```bash
cd dir
```

3. Navigate to your desired directory using the `cd` command. 

    !!! note
        you can only change locations properly if you write the full address

        If you do not write the full address, you may need to use cd.. to navigate backwards.

        For example. moving from documents to downloads
        ```bash
        cd Documents
        cd ..
        cd Downloads
        ``` 

    ```bash
    cd [directory address]
    ```

    <i> For Example: </i>
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\Richard\Documents
    ```


4. Create a new directory using `mkdir`. 

    ```bash
    mkdir [Folder Name]
    ```

    <i> For instance: </i>
    ```
    mkdir NewFolder
    ```

    !!! note

        If you already have a folder with the same file.name in the directory, it will not create a new folder.


5. Navigate to the newly created directory with `cd`:
    ```bash
    cd [Folder Name]
    ```

    <i> Example: </i>
    ```bash
    cd NewFolder
    ```

6. Create a new file by using `echo`. 
    ```bash
    echo. > [file name].txt
    ```

    <i> For example: </i>
    ```bash
    echo. > newfile.txt
    ```

7. Open the file with a text editor.
    ```bash
    [txt editor] [file name].txt
    ``` 

    <i> For example, </i> use Notepad: 

    ```bash
    notepad newfile.txt
    ```

8. Write content to the file using `echo`. 
    ```bash
    echo [content] >> [file name].txt
    ```

    <i> For instance: </i>
    ```bash
    echo Hello, World! >> newfile.txt
    ```

9. Verify the file's content with `type`:

    ```bash
    type [filename].txt
    ```
    <i> For example </i>
    ```bash
    type newfile.txt
    ```
