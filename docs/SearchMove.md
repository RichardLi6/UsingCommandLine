<b> 2. Search for Files</b> 
Use the `dir` command to search for files. For example, to find all `.txt` files in
a directory:

<i>For example</i>, to find all `.txt` files in a directory:
```bash
dir /s /b *.txt
```
<i>For example</i>, to find a specific .txt file in a directory:
```bash
dir /s /b [filename].txt
```
<i>For example</i>, to find a file named 'file.txt' in a directory:
```bash
dir /s /b file.txt
```

<b> 3. Move the File</b> 

Move a file to a new location with the `move` command:


```bash
move C:\[path]\[to]\[source]\[file name].txt C:\[path]\[to]\[destination]\
```
<i>For example</i> To move 'file.txt' from downloads of user Richard to documents:
```
move C:\Users\Richard\Downloads\file.txt C:\Users\Richard\Documents
```

<b> 4. Verify the Move</b> 

Check that the file has been moved to the new location:

```bash
dir C:\path\to\destination\
```

<b> 5. Copy the File</b> 

Copy a file with the `copy` command:

```bash
copy C:\path\to\source\filename.txt C:\path\to\destination\filename.txt
```


<b> 6. Rename the File</b> 

Rename a file using the `ren` or `rename` command:

```bash
ren C:\path\to\filename.txt newfilename.txt
```


<b> 7. Search Within Files</b> 

Search for a specific string within files using `findstr`:

```bash
findstr /s "searchstring" *.txt
```


<b> 8. Organize Search Results</b> 

Sort the search results by name or date using `dir` with sorting flags:

```bash
dir /b /o:n *.txt
```


<b> 9. Selective Move</b> 

Move only certain files using wildcards with `move`:

```bash
move C:\path\to\source\*.txt C:\path\to\destination\
```


<b> 10. Create Directory Structure</b> 

Recreate the directory structure in the destination using `xcopy`:

```bash
xcopy /t /e C:\path\to\source\ C:\path\to\destination\
```
