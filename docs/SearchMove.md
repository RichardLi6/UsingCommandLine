## Introduction
Welcome to the world of command-line mastery. As you embark on this journey, you 
will learn to wield the powerful tools offered by the Windows Command Prompt. The
command line offers precision and speed, qualities essential for effective file 
management. From finding text files tucked away in nested directories to moving
batches of data to new homes, the skills you acquire today will transform your 
tasks into a symphony of keystrokes.


### Open the Command Line
Open the Command Prompt by pressing `Windows Key + R`, typing `cmd`, and pressing Enter.

### Search for Files
Use the `dir` command to search for files. For example, to find all `.txt` files in a directory:

```bash
dir /s /b *.txt
```

### Move the File
Move a file to a new location with the `move` command:

```bash
move C:\path\to\source\filename.txt C:\path\to\destination\
```

### Verify the Move
Check that the file has been moved to the new location:

```bash
dir C:\path\to\destination\
```

### Copy the File
Copy a file with the `copy` command:

```bash
copy C:\path\to\source\filename.txt C:\path\to\destination\filename.txt
```

### Rename the File
Rename a file using the `ren` or `rename` command:

```bash
ren C:\path\to\filename.txt newfilename.txt
```

### Search Within Files
Search for a specific string within files using `findstr`:

```bash
findstr /s "searchstring" *.txt
```

### Organize Search Results
Sort the search results by name or date using `dir` with sorting flags:

```bash
dir /b /o:n *.txt
```

### Selective Move
Move only certain files using wildcards with `move`:

```bash
move C:\path\to\source\*.txt C:\path\to\destination\
```

### Create Directory Structure
Recreate the directory structure in the destination using `xcopy`:

```bash
xcopy /t /e C:\path\to\source\ C:\path\to\destination\
```
